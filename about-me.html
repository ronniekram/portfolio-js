                            special and exciting. That's what drew me to web development. Years of writing recipes and creating menus taught me a great deal about the highs and lows of the creative process. Nothing can beat the reward and feeling
                            of pride from putting out something really special. Working through Flatironâ€™s bootcamp provided me with the same feelings of pride and accomplishment I found in the kitchen.<br><br>I look forward to finding a workplace
                            that fosters growth, both personally and professionally. I am interested in working for companies who care as much about their communities as they do their shareholders, who consider their environmental and societal impacts
                            and consider strong ethics and morals to be their backbone.&nbsp;</p>

We moved back east after a long stay in Portland, OR. I still love to cook and bake. (I'm open to bringing treats to the office!) I enjoy pretty
                            much any hobby where I'm using my hands. Lately it's been macrame, tending to houseplants and home improvement! You can also find me playing pinball on occasion. Those are the bullet points, but I'm an open book!</p>
